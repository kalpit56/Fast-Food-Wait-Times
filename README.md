# What is Quick Eats?

Quick Eats is a mobile application that informs users of wait times for fast food drive-thrus. This application allows users to select a nearby fast food restaurant and view live wait times and an estimated number of vehicles in the drive thru to increase efficiency and decrease the amount of time each person must wait to get their food.

We have created a small mock up of what we envision for our application under the Mockup folder. Please feel free to check it out there through the images or the XD file. You can also access the interactive mockup here: https://xd.adobe.com/view/0fa65ea4-8ded-423b-ad34-a025d7e30547-5af5/screen/32b5a276-9676-45da-bf08-d07a57cc1dc8/
